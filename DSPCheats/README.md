# DSPCheats

Enable several cheat options in the game! Right now the options available are:


UnlockInstantly - Whenever a technology starts being researched, it will unlock instantly.

NoMechaEnergy - Tired of running out of energy with no fuel? Make Icarus use no energy at all!

NoMachineEnergy - Want to make the perfect factory without having to worry about power consumtion? Make machines use no power!

FreeHandcraft - Want a creative mode where you can build anything without cost to make the perfect factory? This is for you.

InstantHandcraft - Everything you craft in the replicator will finish instantly.

InstantBuild - Construction drones build things instantly.

## How to install?
It's recomended to use the mod manager, r2modman-dsp (https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman_dsp/) although you can do it manually.

## How to enable the cheats?
If using r2modman-dsp, go to the Config Editor on the sidebar. If installed manually, edit the configuration file at BepInEx/config/com.Windows10CE.DSPCheats.cfg.
