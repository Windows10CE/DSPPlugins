## How to install?
It's recomended to use the mod manager, r2modman-dsp (https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman_dsp/) although you can do it manually.

## How to enable the cheats?
If using r2modman-dsp, go to the Config Editor on the sidebar. If installed manually, edit the configuration file at BepInEx/config/com.Windows10CE.DSPCheats.cfg.
