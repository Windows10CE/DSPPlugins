# IcarusColorPicker

Simple plugin to change the color of Icarus through a config file. Both the armor and skeleton colors can be changed.

# How to install

It's recommended to use the mod manager at https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman_dsp/, but if you installing the mod manually just put it in BepInEx/plugins.

# How do I change the color?

If using r2modman-dsp, go to the Config Editor on the sidebar. If installed manually, edit the configuration file at BepInEx/config/com.Windows10CE.IcarusColorPicker.cfg.

Setting the colors to greater than 1.0 or less than 0 will cause Icarus to glow or other weird effects. I'm considering this a feature.
